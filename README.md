# speaker recognition
PyTorch implementation of speech embedding net and loss described here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10467.pdf.

Also contains code to create embeddings compatible as input for the speaker diarization model found at https://github.com/google/uis-rnn

![training loss](https://github.com/HarryVolek/PyTorch_Speaker_Verification/blob/master/Results/Loss.png)

The TIMIT speech corpus was used to train the model, found here: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S1,
or here, https://github.com/philipperemy/timit

# Dependencies

* PyTorch 0.4.1
* python 3.5+
* numpy 1.15.4
* librosa 0.6.1

The python WebRTC VAD found at https://github.com/wiseman/py-webrtcvad is required to create run dvector_create.py, but not to train the neural network.

# Preprocessing

Change the following config.yaml key to a regex containing all .WAV files in your downloaded TIMIT dataset. The TIMIT .WAV files must be converted to the standard format (RIFF) for the dvector_create.py script, but not for training the neural network.
```yaml
unprocessed_data: './TIMIT/*/*/*/*.wav'
```
Run the preprocessing script:
```
./data_preprocess.py 
```
Two folders will be created, train_tisv and test_tisv, containing .npy files containing numpy ndarrays of speaker utterances with a 90%/10% training/testing split.

# Training

To train the speaker verification model, run:
```
./train_speech_embedder.py 
```
with the following config.yaml key set to true:
```yaml
training: !!bool "true"
```
for testing, set the key value to:
```yaml
training: !!bool "false"
```
The log file and checkpoint save locations are controlled by the following values:
```yaml
log_file: './speech_id_checkpoint/Stats'
checkpoint_dir: './speech_id_checkpoint'
```
Only TI-SV is implemented.

# Performance

```
EER across 10 epochs: 0.0377
```

# D vector embedding creation

After training and testing the model, run dvector.py to create the data.pkl

The file can be loaded and used to train the triple-loss model.
# Reference
After create dvector,we use the triplet loss to train a model which are discribed here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02304.pdf
When reference speakers,python cli.py
